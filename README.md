# Bear Kingdom

This originated as a serious project and was meant to be an isometric strategy game. Instead, I spontanously turned it into a playground for simulating and testing some ideas from evolutionary game theory.

At them moment it does nothing but simulates a population of furry bears, competing with each other over imaginary resources, and using different strategies, depending on who they encounter. As an actual simulation it's pretty useless and meaningless, because it shows nothing except that some parameters can be tweaked to achieve a certain outcome. Maybe one day I will do something more with it.

## If you *really* want to make some sense of it

Unfortunately all the comments in the code are in Polish. I'm extremely sorry. I guess it is nevertheless possible to understand what's going on. The theoretical model is based on a simple [hawk and dove game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)) you should be familiar with if you had any encounters with game theory. Anyway, don't expect it to do anything interesting.
